# weather_app
The Odin Project. We're creating a weather app. This flexes my api skills. I'm also going to work with css variables and have a dark mode 

# Post finishing
-Everything turned out nicely
-I'm a little tired so there's still bugs most notably:
No responseive UI
-I was struggling with it and given in the next course we're learning advanced html and css. I figure this could wait. Overall not bad test
of my css and javascript skills
#### Note
I'm not going to push this to webpack cuz I'm lazy and I didn't use npm much. So i'm delaying that part of learning til later because it's annoying to do.
